\- Hello everyone!

\- In this presentation, I'm going to talk about why we should upgrade applications, *long-running branch* and *dual boot* strategies as approaches for upgrading Rails applications.

## Shopify's Rails upgrade story

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In &#39;17 it took us 1y to upgrade from <a href="https://twitter.com/rails?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rails</a> 4.2 to 5.0. <a href="https://twitter.com/kirshatrov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kirshatrov</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaelfranca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rafaelfranca</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DaroudeDudek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DaroudeDudek</a> were happy but not satisfied. Why doesn&#39;t this take a week instead of a year? Today, we are running <a href="https://twitter.com/rails?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rails</a> 6.0 in production *before* it releases.</p>&mdash; Jean-Michel Lemieux (@jmwind) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1100759716022636545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></blockquote>
