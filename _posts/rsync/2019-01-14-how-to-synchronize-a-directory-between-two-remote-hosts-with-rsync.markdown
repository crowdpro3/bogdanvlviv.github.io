I usually work by using a laptop, but technically write code, run a development web server, etc. on another host by connecting to it via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).
With lovely [Vim](https://www.vim.org/about.php) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/README), I can easily do bigger percentage of my work in a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

Sometimes I get some work that related to handling some specific files.
It can be done by using some specific desktop applications. After handling those files I have to put them into source of a project I am working on and this project on the remote host.
It means that I should provide some way to transfer data between my laptop and the remote host.
Good idea to synchronize a directory between the hosts.
We can do it with [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).

I use `rsync` of version `3.1.2` in this post:

```bash
bogdanvlviv@laptop:~$ rsync --version
rsync  version 3.1.2  protocol version 31

Let's get started!


Go to the remote host:

```bash
bogdan@server:~$
```

and choose a directory you would like to synchronize with the laptop:

```bash
bogdan@server:~$ mkdir synced-data
```

then choose a directory on the laptop that will mirror the directory on the remote server:

```bash
bogdanvlviv@laptop:~$ mkdir synced-data
```

Create `sync_data.sh` file on the laptop:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rsync --verbose -e "ssh -p 22" --recursive --update --times --archive --compress bogdan@server:/home/bogdan/synced-data/ /home/bogdanvlviv/synced-data
rsync --verbose -e "ssh -p 22" --recursive --update --times --archive --compress /home/bogdanvlviv/synced-data/ bogdan@server:/home/bogdan/synced-data
```

> NOTE: You have to change ssh port, username and server name to your own to make it work!

> NOTE: You can read about `rsync` options via `man rsync`.

To keep the directory synchronized between the hosts we should execute this file with some interval.
You can use `watch` to achieve this, for instance, the next command will execute this file every 3 seconds:

```bash
bogdanvlviv@laptop:~$ watch --interval 3 "bash sync_data.sh"
```

While the command `watch --interval 3 "bash sync_data.sh"` is running, the directory is being synchronized.

> NOTE: You can read about `watch` options via `man watch`.

To check that all is working well, we can go to the remote server and create a new file in the directory we are synchronizing:

```bash
bogdan@server:~$ touch synced-data/new_file.md
```

then go to the synchronized directory on the laptop and to check that the `new_file.md` file is there:

```bash
bogdanvlviv@laptop:~$ ls synced-data/
new_file.md
```

write something to that file:

```bash
bogdanvlviv@laptop:~$ echo "rsync is powerful!" > synced-data/new_file.md
```

and check the file on the server:

```bash
bogdan@server:~$ cat synced-data/new_file.md
rsync is powerful!
```

That is it!
