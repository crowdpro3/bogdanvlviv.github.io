[Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) - Get started with tech.

Our aim is to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas.
We do this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.

Learn sketching, prototyping, basic programming and get introduced to the world of technology.
Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community.
