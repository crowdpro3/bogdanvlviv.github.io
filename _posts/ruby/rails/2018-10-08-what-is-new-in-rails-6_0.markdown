- [Require Ruby 2.5 for Rails 6](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34754)

### [Parallel testing](#parallel-testing)

Pull Requests:
- [Parallel testing](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31900)
- [Add option to set parallel test worker count to the physical core count of the machine](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34735)

You know that class `ActiveSupport::TestCase` uses [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) under the hood (`Minitest::Test` is the superclass of the class).
To `ActiveSupport::TestCase` was added `parallelize` method.
It allows you to parallelize your test suite with forked processes.
Running tests in parallel reduces the time it takes your entire test suite to run.

Running test in threads is supported as well, but note that it doesn't make your test run faster (read ["Minitest Parallelization and You"](http://www.zenspider.com/ruby/2012/12/minitest-parallelization-and-you.html) since it uses [`Minitest::Parallel::Executor`](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/parallel.rb)).

The default parallelization method is to [fork](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0/Kernel.html#method-i-fork) processes using Ruby's [DRb](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0/DRb.html) system.

To enable parallelization with forked processes add the following to your `test/test_helper.rb`:

 ```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: 3, with: :processes)
end
```

The `:workers` option controls how many times the the process is forked or how many threads are used.
The default number of workers is the actual physical core count on the machine you are on:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
end
```

If you would like to parallelize your test suite with threads, you should set `:with` option to `:threads`:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: 3, with: :threads)
end
```

You can also use environment variable `PARALLEL_WORKERS` to easily change the number of workers a test run should use.
This is useful for CI environments or other environments where you may need more or less workers than you do for local testing:

```
PARALLEL_WORKERS=6 bin/rails test
```
When parallelizing test with processes, Active Record automatically handles creating a database and loading the schema into the database for each process. The databases will be suffixed with the number corresponding to the worker.
For example, if you have 2 workers the tests will create `test_database-0` and `test_database-1` databases respectively.
If the number of workers passed is 1 or fewer the processes will not be forked and the tests will not be parallelized and the tests will use the original `test_database` database.
Also, two hooks are provided, one runs when the process is forked but before the tests run, and one runs before the forked process is closed.
These can be useful if your app uses multiple databases or perform other tasks that depend on the number of workers.
The `parallelize_setup` method is called right after the process is forked. The `parallelize_teardown` method is called right before the process is closed:

 ```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize_setup do |worker|
    # code
  end

  parallelize_teardown do |worker|
    # code
  end

  parallelize(workers: 2)
end
```

Note that these methods are not available with the threaded parallelization.

### [ActiveRecord::Relation#pick as shorthand for single-value plucks](#activerecordrelationpick-as-shorthand-for-single-value-plucks)

Pull Requests:
- [Add Relation#pick as short-hand for single-value plucks](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31941)

I am sure you know about the method `#pluck` that [has been in Rails since version 3.2.0](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1915).
Let's refresh our knowledge.
`#pluck` is a shortcut to select one or more attributes without loading a bunch of records just to grab the attributes you want:

```ruby
User.pluck(:name)
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users"
# => ["Bogdan", "David"]

User.where(id: 1).pluck(:name, :email)
# SELECT "users"."name", "users"."email" FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 1]]
# => [["Bogdan", "bogdanvlviv@gmail.com"]]

User.where("1=0").pluck(:name)
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" WHERE (1=0)
# => []
```

But sometimes you just need single value(s) from the result. To get this you can do something like:

```ruby
User.limit(1).pluck(:name).first
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
# => "Bogdan"

User.where(id: 1).limit(1).pluck(:name, :email).first
# SELECT "users"."name", "users"."email" FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
# => ["Bogdan", "bogdanvlviv@gmail.com"]
```

Since Rails 6.0 you can use the method `#pick`, it is shorthand for `limit(1).pluck(*column_names).first`:

```ruby
User.pick(:name)
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
# => "Bogdan"

User.where(id: 1).pick(:name, :email)
# SELECT "users"."name", "users"."email" FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
# => ["Bogdan", "bogdanvlviv@gmail.com"]

User.pick(Arel.sql("UPPER(name)"))
# SELECT UPPER(name) FROM "users" LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
# => "BOGDAN"

User.where("1=0").pick(:name)
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" WHERE (1=0) LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
# => nil
```

You probably noticed that the method `#pluck` does not guarantee the order of the returned value(s) by any column.
So note that `#pick` does not guarantee to return the value(s) of the first row ordered by any column either.
For instance, if you want to get value(s) of the first row ordered by `id` column, you should apply `order(:id)` before `pick`:

```ruby
User.order(:id).pick(:name)
# SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
# => "Bogdan"
```

### [ActiveRecord::Relation#create_or_find_by/! to lean on unique constraints](#activerecordrelationcreate_or_find_by-to-lean-on-unique-constraints)

Pull Requests:
- [Add #create_or_find_by to lean on unique constraints](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31989)
- [#create_or_find_by/!: add more tests and fix docs](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34653)

`#create_or_find_by` attempts to create a record with the given attributes in a table that has a unique constraint
on one or several of its columns.
If a row already exists with one or several of these unique constraints, the exception such an insertion would normally raise is caught and the existing record with those attributes is found using [`#find_by!`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-find_by-21).

This is similar to [`#find_or_create_by`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-find_or_create_by), but avoids the problem of stale reads between the `SELECT` and the `INSERT`, as that method needs to first query the table, then attempt to insert a row if none is found.

There are several drawbacks to `#create_or_find_by`, though:

- The underlying table must have the relevant columns defined with unique constraints.
- A unique constraint violation may be triggered by only one, or at least less than all, of the given attributes. This means that the subsequent `#find_by!` may fail to find a matching record, which will then raise an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception, rather than a record with the given attributes.
- While we avoid the race condition between `SELECT` -> `INSERT` from `#find_or_create_by`, we actually have another race condition between `INSERT` -> `SELECT`, which can be triggered if a `DELETE` between those two statements is run by another client. But for most applications, that's a significantly less likely condition to hit.
- It relies on exception handling to handle control flow, which may be marginally slower.

This method will return a record if all given attributes are covered by unique constraints (unless the `INSERT` -> `DELETE` -> `SELECT` race condition is triggered), but if creation was attempted and failed due to validation errors it won't be persisted, you get what [`#create`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence/ClassMethods.html#method-i-create) returns in such situation.

`#create_or_find_by!` is like `#create_or_find_by`, but calls [`create!`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence/ClassMethods.html#method-i-create-21) so an exception is raised if the created record is invalid.

Implementation of these methods look like:

```ruby
def create_or_find_by(attributes, &block)
  transaction(requires_new: true) { create(attributes, &block) }
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
  find_by!(attributes)
 end

def create_or_find_by!(attributes, &block)
  transaction(requires_new: true) { create!(attributes, &block) }
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
  find_by!(attributes)
end
```

Examples using of these methods:

```ruby
User.create_or_find_by(email: "bogdanvlviv@gmail.com") do |user|
  user.name = "Bogdan"
end

User.create_or_find_by!(email: "bogdanvlviv@gmail.com") do |user|
  user.name = "Богдан"
end
```

- [Add Postmark ingress support to ActionMailbox](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34907)
- [Add Exim and Qmail support to Action Mailbox](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34928)

[Action Mailbox](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/6-0-stable/actionmailbox) allows you to route incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes.
You can read more about Action Mailbox in the [Action Mailbox Basics](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0/action_mailbox_basics.html) guide.

### [Action Text](#action-text)

Pull Requests:
- [Import Action Text](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34873)
- [Add Action Text to guides](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34878)
- [Add `--skip-action-text` option to `rails new`](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34879)

[Action Text](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/6-0-stable/actiontext) brings rich text content and editing to Rails.
It includes the [Trix editor](https://trix-editor.org) that handles everything from formatting to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries.
The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own RichText model that's associated with any existing Active Record model in the application.
Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model.

You can read more about Action Text in the [Action Text Overview](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0/action_text_overview.html) guide.
