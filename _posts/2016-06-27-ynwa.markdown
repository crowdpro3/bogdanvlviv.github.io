## You'll Never Walk Alone

## Gerry and the Pacemakers - You'll Never Walk Alone

When you walk through a storm<br/>
Hold your head up high<br/>
And don't be afraid of the dark<br/>
At the end of a storm<br/>
There's a golden sky<br/>
And the sweet silver song of a lark<br/>
Walk on through the wind<br/>
Walk on through the rain<br/>
Though your dreams be tossed and blown<br/>
Walk on walk on<br/>
With hope in your heart<br/>
And you'll never walk alone<br/>
You'll never walk alone<br/>
Walk on walk on<br/>
With hope in your heart<br/>
And you'll never walk alone<br/>
You'll never walk alone<br/>
