Inspired by [#ruby25th](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ruby25th).

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
Its creator, [Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz).

> Ruby changed my life.

Ruby community is the best in the World - for proof this follow hashtag [#ruby25th](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ruby25th) on Twitter.
I have not seen so kindy feedbacks/thoughts/thanks for any other programming languages.
Ruby definitely deserves it.

> Ruby helped to start my career.

When I finished secondary school I had asked myself "Who do I want to be, what do I want to do, ... ?".
In order to give the answer to these kind of questions I had to remind my childhood's dreams about future professions like a football player, a writer, a programmer, etc.
I stopped at the last one because I always was interested in "how does computer work" and it was one of the most promising profession for that time.

I did not know anything about how this work looks like in real life so had to ask someone who knows.
I knew only one person who works in this area - [Oleksandr Bondar](https://medium.com/@kiosan).
He helped me to see how it looks like.
I was a bit of embarrassed till I saw first Ruby code on his laptop's screen.
It was code with the algorithm of the [Quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) so it was clear for me, but I paid attention to the syntax of the language.
I definitely fell in love what I had seen on the screen but I did not recognize this at that moment, just felt something new.
It was the first time when I met Ruby.

Despite I wrote the first program that outputted `Hello, World!` on [Liberty BASIC](http://libertybasic.com) at secondary school and learned the [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm on [C++](https://isocpp.org) at university I was always spending some time with Ruby, and each next day, the practice time was increasing.

The first book about Ruby that I read is ["Learn to Program" (by Chris Pine)](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram).
This book was the first source that helped me to learn basics of Ruby.
It had happened when I was almost at the finish of a secondary school.

> Recommend you to read ["Ruby Under a Microscope" (by Pat Shaughnessy)](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope) if you wonder how Ruby works internally.

Later [Oleksandr Bondar](https://medium.com/@kiosan) introduced me [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

[Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/README.md) is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) pattern.
Its creator, [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh).

There are thousands [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), one of them I like the most - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails).
<mark>For me, Ruby on Rails is not only an ability to build web applications, it is also an ability to make a contribution to Ruby community and the World.</mark>

> I proud to be a [Ruby on Rails Contributor](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/bogdanvlviv/commits).

[It]({{ "/posts/life/ruby/how-i-met-ruby.html" | absolute_url }}) would not happen `unless` Ruby.

Thank you, [Oleksandr Bondar](https://medium.com/@kiosan), for involving me in Ruby community.

Thank you, [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh), for Ruby on Rails.

Thank you, [Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz), for Ruby.
